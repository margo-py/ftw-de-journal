## 1) 📘 What I Learned


### ⚙️ Main Project Process

- Chinook Database
   - Ex. Pet store 
   - Modeling - conceptual manner
   - Artists, they create music, as store owner, I sell it
      - You can abstract this model and sell it

### 📚 General Data Engineering Concepts

- Start from scratch
- Companies have setups already
- Articulate the flow, how did you ingest, flow, aggregation
   - Assuming perfect kahit ano data, malabo magkamali
   - Talk in pipelines 
      Ingest to raw, clean, move into mart
      Edge cases (ano yung kakaiba? these are opportunities for trade offs)
- 3 Stage Pipeline 
- Sandbox
   - Ephemeral, meant to be exploratory
   - practice muna sa cadaver -> the live prod is raw clean mart
   - Table Vs Views
      - Mechanical Data
      - Table (new copy of data)
      - When to create views and tables?
      - "Saan ba talaga?"
      - DBeaver - check the flow
      - Metabase lang muna - meant for end user. Hindi Data Engineer gagamit ng Metabase. 
      - But putting it in the dbt script, it is permanent, because it is for prod setup
      - Engine = Memory - as soon as shutdown memory, mawawala na data.
      - Pwede magsave ng data sa sandbox ❌ pero not recommended.
      - Did you do it? 🔍
      - Not big in slides si sir, but if you want slide -> data mapping, flow, pipeline design (MOVEMENT OF DATA)
      - DOCUMENTATION - big part of data engineering (nasa doc na lahat)
         - WHAT DO YOU DOCUMENT?
         - Github was bought by microsoft
      - YAML 
        - past 5 years
        - key value pair
      - DATA MODELING
         - how data is structured
         - OLTP OLAP
      - DATA MODEL when it's used as a warehouse
         - cubes - preaggregation, predetermined sql commands
         - OLAP
      - POSTGRE
         - RDBMS
         - (Mas pogi clickhouse)
### Business Perspective
( gives context bakit ganoon data natin )
- On getting data, identify for ex. female male or prefer not to say (ano ba yung model na we're trying to create.)
- Kung tatayo ako ng business, magbebenta ako, what would i do to make that happen?
- Merong customer na bumili dapat can sell dapat
- 💰 Make the sale happen as fast 

### Entity Relationship Model
- Tables
- Attributes
- Relationships - SET OF BUSINESS RULES 
- How SQL was born
   - May relational modeling ()
   - YAML - dictionary (rows and columns)
   - Graphs - represent data

### Normalization
- Safety checks for dirty water
 - 3RD NORMAL FORM
   - Non-key attributes should not depend on another non-key attributes
   - Gform -> try to model -> lalabas issues
- 1NF 
   - atomic
- 2NF
   - nonkey should depend on whole key

### Data Modeling layer
- Conceptual -> Logical -> Physical
- DE's work propagates -> if pangit model -> pangit upstream

### Modeling Approaches
- Kimball / Dimensional - Fact + Dimensions for BI & Dashboards
- Inmon / 3nf edw
- Data Vault
- Lakehouse / Medallion
- Wide Table / OBT
- 5 - 10k Dimensional modeling book
Sir Myk will recommend books soon
- 3:37pm More on Modeling Approaches
- NUP - Computer (systems are expensive~!) 


### Dimensional Modeli ng Workflow
- STAR SCHEMA ⭐️
- Chinook -> invoice -> Fact
   -> Fact -> Info of artists
   Bad Dimension talbe -> halo with facts 

Data Vault
- 100 pax data engineering team

- 
## 2) 📝 New Vocabulary

- Schema - modeling 

---

## 3) 🧠 Data Engineering Mindset

- Data Engineers
 - Meant to scale
 - Meant to be used by a lot of people

## 5) ❓ Open Questions

- SCD2
- Medallion -> raw clean mart
